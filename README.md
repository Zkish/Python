# Python
Here are some of my Python Projects.

so there are a few folder in here which all have different purposes:

the LifeIssues folder has python scripts in it that solve some of my everyday life issues that i come across in the world and through things that im working on.

the MachineLearn folder has analysis's that i made using machine learning.

the Other folder just has a random assortment of things that are uncategorized.
