the Functions folder willl house the functions script that will house all my functions to call upon in all the programs that need certain functions.

the LifeIssues folder has python scripts in it that solve some of my everyday life issues that i come across in the world and through things that im working on.

the MachineLearn folder has analysis's that i made using machine learning.
